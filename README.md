*(do you see the irony??)*

## Why use MAS.js?

- ⚡ **Object-oriented**
- 🛠️ **Intuative syntax**
- 💪 **Extremly flexible**
- 📜 **Promise-based**

MAS.js was built with predictability as a top priority, and the library works in an intuative way to enrich your coding experience. MAS.js was inspired by the way [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) makes use object-oriented programming while still maintaining the speed and reliability you'd expect from a modern library.
